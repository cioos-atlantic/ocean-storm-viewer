        "name":"Air Pressure",
        "definition":"Atmospheric Pressure, also called barometric pressure, is the force per unit area exerted by the atmosphere as a consequence of its weight. It is equal to the weight of a vertical column of air of a unit area, extending from a given elevation or level to the outer limit of the atmosphere. Measurement units for pressure are called hectopascals (hPa)."

        "name":"Humidity",
        "definition":"The direction (true or geographic, not magnetic) from which the wind blows. It represents the average direction during the two minute period ending at the time of observation. Expressed in tens of degrees (10's deg), 9 means 90 degrees true or an east wind, and 36 means 360 degrees true or a wind blowing from the geographic North Pole. A value of zero (0) denotes a calm wind."

        "definition":"The speed of motion of air in kilometres per hour (km/h) usually observed at 10 metres above the ground. It represents the average speed during the one-, two- or ten-minute period ending at the time of observation. In observing, it is measured in nautical miles per hour or kilometres per hour."

        "name":"Humidity",
        "definition":"Gusts are sudden, rapid and brief changes in the wind speed. They are characterized by more or less continual fluctuations between the high (peak) and low (lull) speed. The extreme gust speed is the instantaneous peak wind observed from the anemometer dials, abstracted from a continuous chart recording, or from a data logger."
