# Install NodeJS

Use `npm install` to install necessary modules.

Use `npm run dev` to start development build.

# Setup

Copy .env.template to .env and fill out PostGres connection details

# Errors

> version `GLIBC_2.28' not found (required by node)

May require an older version of node to run

If `npm run dev` starts for a second and then crashes try deleting .next and node_module directories and install and rerun
